# GPU Flocking in openFrameworks
* A very direct port of [Daniel Shiffman's](http://shiffman.net/) Nature of Code Flocking onto the GPU
* Based in part on the excellent openFrameworks GPU particle example 

## Setup
* Clone or download openFrameworks
* Clone this app into apps/myApps/GPU_Flocking
* Run!

## Notes
* You may get errors with the geometry shader if you have an older GPU. It's basically just a bonus anyways.
